require-like\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/felixge/node-require-like.png)](http://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-require-like)\n\nGenerates require functions that act as if they were operating in a given path.\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\nnpm install require-like\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nA require function that acts as if it was executed in `'./lib/bar'`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar requireLike = require('require-like');\nvar myRequire = requireLike(__dirname + '/lib/bar.js');\n\nvar myFoo = myRequire('./foo.js');\nvar foo = require('./lib/foo');\n\nrequire('assert').strictEqual(myFoo, foo);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### requireLike(path, [uncached])\n\nReturns a require function that acts as if it was operating in the given\n`path`.\n\nSetting the `uncached` parameter to true returns a function that by-passes the\nmodule cache.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThis module works by accessing some private node APIs. You shouldn't worry about\nthat so, since I will make sure this module does not break in the future by\neither patching it, or making a patch for node that makes the needed APIs\npublic.\n\n## What to do with this\n\nI use this library for dependency injection in unit tests. However, you could\nalso use it to create experimental require addons yourself.\n\n## License\n\nrequire-like is licensed under the MIT license.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"felixge","email":"felix@debuggable.com"}],"directories":{}}},"maintainers":[{"name":"felixge","email":"felix@debuggable.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-12-28T23:55:13.938Z","created":"2011-06-25T14:12:52.464Z","0.0.1":"2011-06-25T14:12:53.086Z","0.0.2":"2011-06-25T18:03:47.194Z","0.1.0":"2011-07-07T23:12:58.309Z","0.1.1":"2011-11-20T13:17:13.179Z","0.1.2":"2012-02-22T08:46:13.466Z"},"author":{"name":"Felix Geisendörfer","email":"felix@debuggable.com","url":"http://debuggable.com/"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/felixge/node-require-like.git"},"users":{"gozala":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"6J46WNCZ2MYLIQHEPDM9I1YVE\""}
